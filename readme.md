This covers the entire journey a customer takes, from landing on site to completing a purchase.

E-Commerce Website: User-Side Flow & Architecture
This document outlines the core user-facing features, the project's folder structure, and the necessary database collections.

## 1. The User Journey: A Step-by-Step Logic Flow
This is the complete lifecycle of a customer interaction on your site.

### Step 1: Browsing and Discovery (Homepage / Shop Page)
Action: The user visits your website. They see the main navigation (Home, Shop, etc.) and the unique vertical navigation with price-point categories (₹399, ₹499).

Backend Logic: The server fetches all products and categories from the MongoDB database to display them. This can be highly optimized using Next.js's Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for fast load times.

Frontend Logic: The user can click on a category to filter products or click on a specific product to view its details.

### Step 2: The Shopping Cart
This is a critical feature that needs to handle two types of users: guests and logged-in customers.

Action (Add to Cart): On a product page, the user selects a size and color, then clicks "Add to Cart".

Logic:

The selected product variant (e.g., "Red, 6-7Y") and quantity are added to a cart object.

For a guest user, this cart object can be stored in the browser's localStorage. This way, if they close the tab and come back, their cart is still there.

For a logged-in user, the cart is saved to the Carts collection in your MongoDB database, linked to their user ID. This allows them to see their cart on any device.

Action (View/Edit Cart): The user navigates to the Cart page.

Logic:

The page displays all items from their cart (localStorage for guests, the database for users).

Users can update the quantity of an item. This triggers a function to update the cart object.

Users can delete an item. This triggers a function to remove the item from the cart object.

A subtotal and total are calculated and displayed in real-time.

### Step 3: The Checkout Process
Action: The user clicks "Checkout" from the cart page.

Logic:

The system prompts the user to log in or sign up if they are a guest. A persistent cart would sync their localStorage cart to their account upon login.

The user is taken to a checkout page where they fill in their shipping address and contact information.

Since you're skipping the payment gateway for now, you can have a "Confirm Order" button.

### Step 4: Order Confirmation & Inventory Update (Post-Checkout)
This is the most important backend process.

Action: The user clicks "Confirm Order".

Logic: This triggers a critical API call to your backend that does two things in sequence:

Create an Order: A new document is created in the Orders collection. This document is a permanent record of the sale, containing the user's ID, the products they bought, the total price, and the shipping address.

Update Inventory: The system goes through each item in the newly created order. For each product variant purchased, it finds that specific variant in the Products collection and decrements its quantity. This ensures you never sell an item that is out of stock.

Clear the Cart: The user's cart in the Carts collection is now cleared, as its contents have been converted into an order.

The user is redirected to a "Thank You" page with their order summary.

## 2. Proposed Project Structure (Next.js with App Router)
A clean folder structure is key to a maintainable project.

## 3. MongoDB Database Collections Schema
Based on our brainstorming, you will need five core collections.

### 1. Users
Purpose: Stores customer and admin account information.

Schema:

_id: Unique User ID

name: String

email: String (unique)

password: String (hashed)

role: String ('user' or 'admin')

createdAt: Timestamp

### 2. Products
Purpose: Stores all information about each frock.

Schema:

_id: Unique Product ID

name: String

serial_no: String (unique)

description: String

images: Array of Strings (URLs)

category: Reference to a Categories _id

tags: Array of Strings

variants: Array of Objects

color: String

size: String

quantity: Number

### 3. Categories
Purpose: To store your unique price-point categories for the navigation.

Schema:

_id: Unique Category ID

price_tag: Number (e.g., 399, 499)

display_name: String (e.g., "Frocks at ₹399")

### 4. Carts (The first "???" collection)
Purpose: To temporarily store the contents of a logged-in user's shopping cart.

Schema:

_id: Unique Cart ID

userId: Reference to a Users _id (unique)

items: Array of Objects

productId: Reference to a Products _id

variant: Object (e.g., { color: "Red", size: "6-7Y" })

quantity: Number

updatedAt: Timestamp

### 5. Orders (The second "???" collection)
Purpose: A permanent record of a completed transaction.

Schema:

_id: Unique Order ID

userId: Reference to a Users _id

items: Array of Objects (a copy of the cart items at the time of purchase)

totalAmount: Number

shippingAddress: Object

status: String (e.g., 'Pending', 'Shipped', 'Delivered')

createdAt: Timestamp
